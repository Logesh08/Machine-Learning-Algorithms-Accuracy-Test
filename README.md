# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Accuracy-Test
  The program gives the accuracy of Machine Learning Algorithms such as <b>Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K Neighbors Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Classifier</b> by using a known Iris dataset. So the accuracy of each algorithms is calculated by validating with the datasets
